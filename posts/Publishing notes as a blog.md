# Publishing Notes as a Blog

Using Astro, obsidian, and cloudflare pages to publish my notes in real time.

Maybe I could stick in some [[AI]]  to summarise blog posts in the preview cards?

Could use a picsum to load images for blog posts.

## How Easy Can Deploying a Website Be?

Also working on a cli for [[Deploying Websites]].

## Why Am I Doing This?

I find myself full of ideas, and importantly I am often repeating ideas in my head. Writing down my thoughts and revisiting them has already proven a great way to build my thoughts into ideas, rather than letting them circulate and drift.

## What This Process Has Taught Me

### Don’t Link Chapters in Footnotes

Learning to [[Write everything down]] has encouraged me to write better. Arbitrarily linked files imply the existence of an unfinished thought. Linking notes in proper sentences has encouraged [[Explicit over Implicit behaviour]] by motivating me to describe why two things are connected.

Notes either opt in or opt out. I’d like to have notes opt out because it encourages me to [[Work with the garage door open]].
