# What Did Types Ever Do for Us?

So much of the Ruby defenders defence is along the lines of “just don’t do that lol”. This is true for their type system and it’s true for many other parts of the language. Yes, technically this is a “skill issue”, but the fact is programmers aren’t perfect. What makes a programming language great isn’t how it feels when you know what everything does, it’s how it feels when you don’t know anything. Languages and frameworks need to show you how they work, and it should be self evident and explicit. Ruby (and RoR) has the exact opposite approach.
